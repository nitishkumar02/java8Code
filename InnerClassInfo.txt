Class inside another Class is called Inner Class

without existing one type of Object, if there is no chance of existing another type of object, then we should go for Inner class
ex.1 University and department

class university
{
   class department
    {
     
     }
 }
 complie: javac university.java
 result: university.class , university$department.class
 
 ex.2 Car And Engine
 
 class Car
 {
    class Engine
    {
      
     }
  } 
  
  2. Based on position of declaration and behaviour, all Inner classes are divided into Four types:
    1. Normal or Regular Inner classes
    2. method local inner classes
    3. Anonaymous inner classes
    4. static nested classes
    
Anonymous Inner Classes ......
  Inner Class without name
  purpose - instant use or say one time usage
  
  Based on declaration and behaviour , three types of Anonymous inner class
  1.Anonymous inner class that extend a class
  2.Anonymous inner class that implements an Interface
  3.Anonymous inner class that defined inside arguments
  
  1.Example: Anonymous inner class that extend Concrete class
  class Test
  {
  }
  
  Test t = new Test
  {
  
  }
  
  2. Example: Anonymous Inner class that Extends Abstract class
  
  abstract class Test
  {
  
  }
  
  Test t = new Test()
  {
  
  }
  
  3. Example: Anonymous Innner Class That implements an Interface Which Contains Multiple Methods
  
  inetrface Test
  {
   public void m1();
   public void m2();
   public void m3();
   }
   
   Test t = new Test()
   {
    public void m1();
    public void m2();
    public void m3();
    }
    
    4. Example: Anonymous Innner Class That implements an Interface Which Contains Single Abstract Methods
    interface Test
    {
    public void m1();
    }
    
    Test t = new Test()
    {
   
   public void m1()
    {
      System.out.println("Hey");
    
    }
    }
    ... Test t = ()->System.out.println("Hey");
