Class inside another Class is called Inner Class

without existing one type of Object, if there is no chance of existing another type of object, then we should go for Inner class
ex.1 University and department

class university
{
   class department
    {
     
     }
 }
 complie: javac university.java
 result: university.class , university$department.class
 
 ex.2 Car And Engine
 
 class Car
 {
    class Engine
    {
      
     }
  }
